    <h1>What is a Begemot (бегемот) ?</h1>
    <p>A Begemot is also know as a Hippopotamus. The Hippo is a semi aquatic mammal that is native to the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek word for river horse. The Begemot differs greatly from other large land mammals, it spends most of it's days in lakes and rivers and leaves the water under the cover of nightfall to eat and forage in the undergrowth. A Hippo can sleep under water and submerges itself completely uninterrupted without waking to breathe on the surface.</p>
