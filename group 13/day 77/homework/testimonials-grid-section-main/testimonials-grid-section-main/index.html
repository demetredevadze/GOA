            <h2 style="font-weight: 100; color: gray;">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
  professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
  student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
  did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait l0ong for <br> assistance. The agile team 
  project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
  experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
  100% recommend! ”</h2>
