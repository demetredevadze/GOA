<h1>History</h1>
<p>Traces of human life in Kakheti date back to the Stone Age. According to the discovered material, people lived permanently in the Stone Age on the territory of Kakheti. Traces of human life here must be defined between 2 million 300 thousand years and 10,000 years BC. In the II and III millennia of the IV millennium BC (Early Bronze Age) the Mtkvari-Araksi culture was widespread on the territory of Kakheti, as well as in the whole central part of the South Caucasus. Kakheti was one of the main places for the spread of Trialeti culture in the Middle Bronze Age.

The establishment of Kakheti as a separate territorial unit is attributed to Kakhos, one of the sons of the Georgian ethnarch, Kartlos. In ancient times, Kakheti covered a much smaller area, namely Ertso-Tianeti and Pkhovi, the center of which was Cheleti (Zhaleti). After Kartlos's wife redistributed the territory of Kartli to her sons, Kakho received the above-mentioned borders. But during the same Kakhos period, he ceded to his brother Kukhos the left bank of the Iori River from Lapiankhevi to Bochorma Fortress. From the 4th century, the center of Kakheti was Ujarma, built by King Asfarug. The borders of Kakheti were expanded in the east. By the VIII century, it covered an important part of Kukheti and Hereti. In the 11th century, the city of Telavi became the center of the region. In the XV century, after the disintegration of Georgia, the Kingdom of Kakheti was formed. From that time, the center of Kakheti became Gremi. In the XVI-XVII centuries, Kakheti was separated from the north-eastern part, which today bears the name of Saingilo and is administratively included in Azerbaijan. In the second half of the 17th century, the center of Kakheti moved to Telavi again. The Kingdom of Kakheti existed until the XIX century. Based on the current regional division, historical Kakheti has the status of a territorial-administrative side.</p>
