<p>Samegrelo is a historical - geographical side of western Georgia that covers the territories between the rivers Rioni, Tskhenistskali, Enguri and the Black Sea. Its central city is Zugdidi. The Samegrelo region had a great strategic importance throughout its history, because of this, it became the object of numerous invasions by armies of the Romans, Byzantines, Mongols, Turks, Persians, Russians and others. This region is rich in cultural monuments of different eras and impressive nature, blue lakes and very beautiful canyons.</p>




 <h1>History</h1>
<p>აIn ancient times, Samegrelo was a part of the Kingdom of Colchis. Colchis completely covered the territory of present-day western part of Georgia. Prior to the modern era, the region was also known as Lazika and Egrisi. Its political center was Archeopolis (or Nokalakevi). The myth of the Argonauts and the Golden Fleece is related to Nokalakevi. The Romans conquered this area in the first century BC and ruled it for almost 400 years. In the XI century, the western and eastern Georgia were united into one kingdom, which existed until the XI century. By the end of the XI century, Georgia was divided into three independent states: Kartli, Kakheti and Imereti. Several principalities were created, one of which was Odishi. It covered the whole territory of present-day Samegrelo. From the middle of the XII century through the XIX century, Odishi was ruled by the representatives of the Dadiani family.

    In 1803, Odishi became a protectorate of Russia. By this time the eastern Georgia was already under the Russian rule. In 1918, Georgia declared independence and Samegrelo became a part of the new democratic country. Today the territory of the principality of historic Samegrelo is part of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti administrative region.</p>




 <h1>Culture</h1>
<p> Samegrelo is a very interesting place with its historical past and customs. The interest in the mode of life of this region was great in the past. Greek writers considered Colchis the descendants of the biblical son of Noah - Yaphet and Herodotus regarded them as a people of Egyptian descent. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote that the Colchians did not bury the dead in the ground, but they wrapped them up in the leather and hung on the tree. According to Herodotus, the custom of the Colchians was circumcision. Neighboring cultures had a big influence on such customs. Along with religious cultures from outside, worship of trees and others were spread in Colchis, part of which is still preserved in Samegrelo, mostly in the high mountain villages. One of the traditions is the “share of the crow”, in which the eggshell is filled with Ghomi and cheese, then they throw it up on the roof with the words: “share of the crow”, after which the crow will not take away the chickens. In all parts of Georgia the ritual of weeping was very important. In this respect, the well-known tradition is the Megrelian “Zari”- a ritual song for the weeping of the dead. Samegrelo is also rich in Folklor. The most famous Megrelian folk song is “Megrelian Nana”- the lullaby, one of which tunes were used by the Russian composer Peter Tchaikovsky in his famous Christmas ballet - The Nutcracker. You have probably heard a lot about this wonderful and little poem:



    The sun in my mother,
    
    The moon is my father,
    
    Thin- tiny stars
    
    Sister and my brother.
    
    
    
    Many travelers note the beauty of Megrelians. Their exquisite garments are also notable. The long chokha was first worn by Megrelians. You can see the Megrelian woman's silk dress, embroidered with gold thread, at the National Museum of Georgia.
    
    It is impossible to talk about Samegrelo and not to mention the kitchen. Traditional Megrelian food is spicy and full with seasoning. The reason is because of the mild, subtropical climate of ancient times. Malaria was a major threat to Samegrelo, and residents in the area have found from the outset that consuming large amounts of pepper has somehow prevented the development of a terrible disease. Finally, spicy seasonings have become a traditional attribute of Megrelian cuisine. Megrelian Sulguni, Ajika, Satsivi are well-known, however Elarji takes an advance position, which is made of Ghomi and Sulguni and leaves no one indifferent. We must also mention wine. There are more than 500 sorts of vine cultivated in Georgia, and 60 are cultivated in Samegrelo. The most prominent of these sorts are the Ojaleshi grapes, from which the best wine is produced; It is a semi - sweet red wine, characterized by a faint aroma of wild rose and a bright red color.
